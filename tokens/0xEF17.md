ZQuadrant1 was introduced in OS 2.53MP. As it's name might imply, it puts Quadrant I in the viewing window (the upper-left quadrant). Here are the window settings it affects:

*   Xmin is set to 0 and Xmax is set to 9.4 making each pixel .1 units.
*   Ymin is set to 0 and Ymax is set to 9.4 (each pixel is 47/310 units)
*   Xscl and Yscl are set to 1
*   ΔX is set to .1
*   ΔY is set to 47/310
