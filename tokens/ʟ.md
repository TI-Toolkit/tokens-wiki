The ʟ command indicates the beginning of a custom list (i.e., any list the user creates, not including the default lists `L₁`…`L₆`). You almost always need to include this when accessing or manipulating a custom list. The maximum length of the list name (not including the ʟ) is five letters. ʟABCDE works, but ʟABCDEF does not.

## Optimization

You don't need to include the ʟ command when [storing](/store) (→) to a list. Some of the list commands also allow for this optimization, such as [SetUpEditor](/setupeditor). However, it can create problems when using [Input](/input) and [Prompt](/prompt) because you might only be asking the user to input a list, but a real variable would also be allowed.

## Error Conditions

*   **[ERR:SYNTAX](/errors#syntax)** is thrown if you try to reference/create a list with more than 5 characters in its name.
*   **[ERR:UNDEFINED](/errors#undefined)** is thrown if you try to use ʟ on an undefined list.
