# `°`

## Overview



<b>Availability</b>: Token available everywhere.

## Syntax
`°`

<hr>

## Description

Normally, when the calculator is in radian mode, the trigonometric functions only return values calculated in radians. With the ° symbol you can have the angle evaluated as if in degree mode because it converts the angle into radians.

You can insert the degree symbol by pressing [2ND] [ANGLE] [ENTER].

One full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. To convert an angle in radians to degrees you multiply by 180/π, and to convert from degrees to radians multiply by π/180.

In radian mode:

```ti-basic
sin(45)        \\ actually calculating sin(2578.31)
    .8509035245
sin(45°)
    .7071067812
```

In degree mode:

```ti-basic
sin(45)
    .7071067812
sin(45°)
    .7071067812    \\ There's no difference when in degrees
```

## Converting Degrees, Minutes & Seconds

The degree symbol also allows you to convert degrees, minutes and seconds into decimal degrees. For example:

```ti-basic
90°30'
       90.5
90°30'09"
       90.5025
```

The minute symbol is inserted by pressing [2ND] [ANGLE] [2]. The seconds symbol is inserted via [ALPHA] [+].

To convert back the other way (decimal to degrees-minutes-seconds) use the <tt><a href="►DMS.md">►DMS</a></tt> command, accessed via [2ND] [ANGLE] [4]:

```ti-basic
90.5025►DMS
       90°30'09"
```

## Optimization

When you only call the trig function once in a program and want it calculated in degrees, instead of changing the mode you can just use ° to save one-byte (the newline from using the command Degree)

```ti-basic
:Degree
:sin(X)
can be
:sin(X°)
```
