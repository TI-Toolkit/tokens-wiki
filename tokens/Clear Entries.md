# `Clear Entries`

## Description
Clears the contents of the Last Entry storage area.


<b>Availability</b>: Token available everywhere.

## Syntax
`Clear Entries`

## Location
<tt><kbd><b>2nd</b></kbd></tt>, <kbd>mem</kbd>, `MEMORY`, `3:Clear Entries`
<hr>

Normally, by pressing 2nd ENTER repeatedly, you can cycle through some of the recent entries on the home screen. With the `Clear Entries` command, this history is cleared (only `Clear Entries` remains in the history).

This can be used to free some memory, although it's recommended not to do this in a program (because clearing things without asking first isn't nice). Aside from that, maybe the only reason to use `Clear Entries` is to protect your privacy — although someone looking at your entries will know you cleared something, so it's not that effective.
