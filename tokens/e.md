## Syntax
`E`

<hr>

<tt><em>e</em></tt> is a constant on the TI-83 series calculators. The constant holds the approximate value of [Euler's number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html), fairly important in calculus and other higher-level mathematics.

The approximate value, to as many digits as stored in the calculator, is 2.718281828459‚Ä¶

The main use of <tt><em>e</em></tt> is as the base of the exponential function <tt><a href="e^(.md">e^(</a></tt> (which is also a separate function on the calculator), and its inverse, the natural logarithm <tt><a href="ln(.md">ln(</a></tt>. From these functions, others such as the trigonometric functions (e.g. <tt><a href="sin(.md">sin(</a></tt>) and the hyperbolic functions (e.g. <tt><a href="sinh(.md">sinh(</a></tt>) can be defined. In <tt><a href="re^Œ∏ùëñ.md">re^Œ∏ùëñ</a></tt> mode, <tt><em>e</em></tt> is used in an alternate form of expressing complex numbers.

Important as the number <tt><em>e</em></tt> is, nine times out of ten you won't need the constant itself when using your calculator, but rather the <tt>e^(</tt> and <tt>ln(</tt> functions.
