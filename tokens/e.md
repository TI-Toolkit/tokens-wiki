## Syntax
`E`

<hr>

_e_ is a constant on the TI-83 series calculators. The constant holds the approximate value of [Euler's number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html), fairly important in calculus and other higher-level mathematics.

The approximate value, to as many digits as stored in the calculator, is 2.718281828459…

The main use of _e_ is as the base of the exponential function [e^(](/e-exponent) (which is also a separate function on the calculator), and its inverse, the natural logarithm [ln(](/ln). From these functions, others such as the trigonometric functions (e.g. [sin(](/sin)) and the hyperbolic functions (e.g. [sinh(](/sinh)) can be defined. In [re^θi](/re-thetai) mode, _e_ is used in an alternate form of expressing complex numbers.

Important as the number _e_ is, nine times out of ten you won't need the constant itself when using your calculator, but rather the `e^(` and `ln(` functions.
