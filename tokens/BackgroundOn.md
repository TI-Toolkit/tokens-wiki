With the introduction of color and a higher resolution screen than the monochrome calculators, the TI-84+CSE and TI-84+CE included the ability to display a background image on the graphscreen. The images variables are similar to the picture variables in that there 10 slots. In addition, functions can be drawn on top of images.

<tt>BackgroundOn</tt> recalls an image variable or color and displays it on the graphscreen.

```ti-basic
:BackgroundOn Image1
is the same as
:BackgroundOn 1
```

Intrestingly, the following is a valid syntax, which fills the graphscreen with a light blue (18).

```ti-basic
:15â†’B
:BackgroundOn B+3
```

In addition, <tt>BackgroundOn</tt> can be used to fill the graphscreen with a solid color. The color variables range from 10 to 24, blue to dark gray, as documented [here](textcolor). For example, <tt>BackgroundOn</tt> 12 will fill the graphscreen with black.

```ti-basic
:BackgroundOn 12
```

## Error Conditions

*   **[ERR:DOMAIN](errors#dimmismatch)** is thrown if the number is not an integer between 0 and 24.
