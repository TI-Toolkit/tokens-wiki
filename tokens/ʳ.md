## Syntax
`ʳ`

<hr>



Normally, when the calculator is in degree mode, the trigonometric functions only return values calculated in degrees. With the <tt><sup>r</sup></tt> symbol you can have the angle evaluated as if in radian mode because it converts the angle into degrees.

One full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. To convert an angle in radians to degrees you multiply by 180/π, and to convert from degrees to radians multiply by π/180.

In degree mode:

```ti-basic
sin(π)        \\sine of Pi degrees
    .0548036651
sin(π^^r)
    0
```

  
In radian mode:

```ti-basic
sin(π)
    0
sin(π^^r)
    0        \\There's no difference when in radians
```

## Optimization

When you only call the trig function once in a program and want it calculated in radians, instead of changing the mode you can just use <tt>°</tt> to save one-byte (the newline from using the command <tt>Radian</tt>)

```ti-basic
:Radian
:sin(X)
can be
:sin(X^^r)
```
