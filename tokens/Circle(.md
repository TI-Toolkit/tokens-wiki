`Circle(` will draw a circle at (_X_,_Y_) with radius _r_. _X_ and _Y_ will be affected by the window settings. The radius will also be affected by the window settings.

```ti-basic
:Circle(5,5,5)
```

## Advanced Uses

The radius of a circle is affected by the window settings. This means that if the x- and y-increment is two, the radius will be two pixels. However, there is another way to take advantage of this to draw ellipses. If the x- and y-increment are different, then the shape will not be a circle. For instance, with Xmin=0, Xmax=20, Ymin=0, and Ymax=31, `Circle(10,10,2)` will draw an ellipse, where the width is greater than the height.

## Optimization

If a complex list such as {ùëñ} is passed to `Circle(` as the fourth argument, the "fast circle" routine is used instead, which uses the symmetries of the circle to only do 1/8 of the trig calculations. For example:

```ti-basic
:Circle(0,0,5
can be
:Circle(0,0,5,{i
```

Any list of complex numbers will work as the fourth argument in the same way, but there's no benefit to using any other list.

Note: The "fast circle" routine is not available on the TI-84+CSE or TI-84+CE calculators.

## Command Timings

The ordinary `Circle(` is extremely slow. The fast circle trick discussed above cuts the time down to only about 30% of the "slow `Circle(`" time! While still not instant, this is faster than any replacement routine that can be written in TI-Basic.

For small radii, replace `Circle(` with `Pt-On(` instead.
