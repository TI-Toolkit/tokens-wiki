# `ClrTable`

## Description
Clears all values from the table.


<b>Availability</b>: Token only available from within the Basic editor.

## Syntax
`ClrTable`

## Location
<tt><kbd><b>prgm</b></kbd></tt>, `I/O`, `9:ClrTable`
<hr>

The <tt>ClrTable</tt> command clears all calculations for the table screen shown if you press 2nd TABLE. That is, all already-calculated values in the table are cleared, and [TblInput](system-variables#window) is deleted. In <tt><a href="IndpntAuto.md">IndpntAuto</a></tt> and <tt><a href="DependAuto.md">DependAuto</a></tt> mode, this usually isn't noticeable because the table will be recalculated almost immediately when you next look at it (unless one of the entered functions is so complicated it takes a while to calculate). This mainly has an effect in <tt><a href="IndpntAsk.md">IndpntAsk</a></tt> or <tt><a href="DependAsk.md">DependAsk</a></tt> mode, where the corresponding parts of the table will be cleared entirely.

## Advanced Uses

As a side effect, <tt>ClrTable</tt> seems to have all the effects of <tt><a href="ClrDraw.md">ClrDraw</a></tt> â€” it clears the graph screen, and any equations or plots will be regraphed the next time the graph screen is displayed.

## Command Timings

<tt>ClrTable</tt> and <tt>ClrDraw</tt> take the same amount of time to clear the screen.
