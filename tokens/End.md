The `End` command is used together with the different control structures, including the [If](/if) conditional, [While](/while) loop, [Repeat](/repeat) loop, and [For(](/for) loop, to indicate the _end_ of the code block for the respective control structure. In the case of the `If` conditional, you also need to add a [Then](/if) command, which is used to indicate the beginning of the control structure.

## Advanced Uses

You can prematurely end a control structure by using a single `If` conditional and then having `End` be its executed command. Because the calculator stores the positions of the `End` commands, it will take this `End` command to be the `End` command of the control structure.

```ti-basic
:If <condition>
:End
```

One of the most important features of the `End` command is putting multiple control structures inside of each other (known as nesting). While you typically nest `If` conditionals inside of loops, you can actually nest any control structure inside of any other control structure â€” this even works when using the same control structure, such as a `While` loop inside of another `While` loop.

When nesting control structures, you need to remember to put the appropriate number of `End` commands to close the appropriate structure. The easiest way to keep track of lots of nested control structures is to code the first part, add an `End` immediately after the beginning, and then hit 2nd DEL on the line with the `End`, then hit ENTER a lot of times.
