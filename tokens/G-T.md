<b>Availability</b>: Token only available from within the Basic editor.

`G-T` puts the calculator into "Graph-Table" mode: this mode shows the home screen at full size, but the graph screen and table will be displayed together, each taking up half the screen (divided vertically).

`G-T` is usually used at the beginning of a program to ensure that the screen mode is `G-T` , for programs such as math programs that want to demonstrate the thinking step-by-step.

```ti-basic
:G-T
```

With OS version 2.30 (on the TI-84+ and TI-84+ SE calculators), `G-T` mode can be used with stat plots as well.
