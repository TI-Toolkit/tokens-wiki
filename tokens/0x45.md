# `E`

## Overview



<b>Availability</b>: Token available everywhere.

## Syntax
`E`

<hr>

## Description

The <tt>E</tt> symbol is used for entering numbers in scientific notation: it's short for *10^. This means that in many cases, its function is identical to that of the <tt><a href="10^(.md">10^(</a></tt> command (aside from the parenthesis). However, the exponent of <tt>E</tt> is limited to constant integer values ‾99 to 99.

The <tt>E</tt> symbol is used in display by the calculator for large numbers, or when in <tt><a href="Sci.md">Sci</a></tt> (scientific) or <tt><a href="Eng.md">Eng</a></tt> (engineering) mode.

Unlike the exponent of <tt>E</tt>, the mantissa (a special term for the A in A*10^B, in scientific notation) isn't limited in variable type: it can be a constant, a real or complex variable or expression, a list, a matrix, or even omitted entirely (and then it will be assumed to equal 1). The reason for this versatility is simple: internally, only the exponent is taken to be an actual argument for this command. The rest of the calculation is done through implied multiplication.

## Advanced Uses

<tt>E</tt>99 and -<tt>E</tt>99 are often used for negative and positive infinity because the TI-83 series of calculators doesn't have an infinity symbol. Commands that often need to use infinity include <tt><a href="solve(.md">solve(</a></tt>, <tt><a href="fnInt(.md">fnInt(</a></tt>, <tt><a href="normalcdf(.md">normalcdf(</a></tt> (and the other distributions), and many others. The error introduced in this way is usually irrelevant, because it's less than the minimum calculator precision, anyway: <tt>E</tt>99 is mindbogglingly huge.

## Optimization

Don't add the mantissa when it's 1:

1E5  
should be  
E5

In addition, <tt>E</tt>2 or <tt>E</tt>3 can be used as shorthand ways of writing 100 and 1000 respectively. This could be continued, in theory, for higher powers of 10, but those aren't necessary as often.

## Command Timings

<tt>E</tt> is much faster than using the <tt><a href="10^(.md">10^(</a></tt> command or typing out 10^. The drawback, of course, is that it's limited to constant values.
