## Description

The → (store) command will store a number, variable, or expression to a variable, using the respective value(s) of the variable(s) at the time. When storing a value in a variable, you have the value on the left side of → and the variable that it will be stored to on the right side.

```ti-basic
:1→X
           1

:{1.3,5.7,9.11→ABC
           {1.3 5.7 9.11}

:"HELLO WORLD→Str1
           "HELLO WORLD"
```

## Advanced

It's not easy to put a → symbol into a string, since "→→Str1 would produce a syntax error (and in general, when the calculator 'sees' a → symbol, it assumes that the string is over, and interprets the symbol literally).

However, you can use [Equ►String(](equ-string) (outside a program) to get the → or " symbols in a string:

1.  Type them on the home screen and press [ENTER]
2.  Select 1:Quit when the **[ERR:SYNTAX](errors#syntax)** comes up.
3.  Press [Y=] to go to the equation editor.
4.  Press [2nd] [ENTRY] to recall the symbols to Y<sub>1</sub>
5.  Now, use Equ►String(Y<sub>1</sub>,Str1) to store the symbols to a string.

## Optimization

You can remove closing parentheses, braces, brackets, and quotes that are before a → command.

Here are a series of examples of using the → command. The first line of each example uses more bytes than necessary. The line following strips out the unnecessary characters and uses less bytes.

##### Real Variables

```ti-basic
1/(2*(3/4))→X
1/(2(3/4→X
```

##### Strings

```ti-basic
"Hello"→Str1
"Hello→Str1
```

##### Lists

```ti-basic
{1,2,3,2(X+1)}→L₁
{1,2,3,2(X+1→L₁
```

```ti-basic
5→L₁(1)
5→L₁(1
```

```ti-basic
{4,5,6}→ʟLISTX
{4,5,6→LISTX
```

Tip: You can remove the <tt>ʟ</tt> character when storing an entire list to a custom named list, but you must keep the <tt>ʟ</tt> character present when storing to a specific item, such as <tt>3→ʟLISTX(1</tt>
