# TI Toolkit Tokens Wiki

Welcome to the tokens wiki! This project aims to collect and organize documentation for every token on the TI-83 series of calculators, sourced from both TI's official reference and community contributions. Each page corresponds to a single token, and includes the token's syntax, functionality, location, translations, error conditions, and other information.

While several documentation sites have emerged over the years, many are no longer actively maintained. The tokens wiki is intended to fill in these gaps, as well as provide documentation that is both human- and machine-readable.

You can view the pages either directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/TI-Toolkit/tokens-wiki) or on [GitHub Pages](https://ti-toolkit.github.io/tokens-wiki/). Each token is indexed by its bytes (e.g. ``Ox14``) and readable name (e.g. ``augment(``), with some escaping to make the names web-safe. Our sources are listed [here](https://github.com/TI-Toolkit/tokens-wiki/blob/main/sources.md), with attributions found at the bottom of each page. Contributions welcome!
